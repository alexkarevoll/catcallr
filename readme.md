### The 2-Player, turn-based stray cat coaxing simulator you've been waiting for!

![Cat](http://i.imgur.com/OJiCdCN.png)

Taking turns, two players attempt to convince a cat to come to their side of the game board using whatever means necessary.

Using deductive reasoning, players will attempt to find out what kind of cat they are dealing with and use the moves available to them on their turn. Players must pay careful attention to their opponent's choices, because they just might reveal information they can exploit when it's their turn to call that cat.

#### Controls:
Players use the arrow keys or their mouse to select from a randomized set of choices each turn.
